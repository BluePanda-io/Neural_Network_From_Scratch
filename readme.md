Building a Neural Network from Zero without a FrameWork like TensorFlow or Pytorch - Originally developed 25/01/2019

### You can just open the Jupyter Notebook and you will find everything there 



## In this project it was developed 
A Neural Network from scratch without the help of a FrameWork. This was an amazing expirience, it was really powerfull to expirience all the difficulties of building a neural network from scratch you needed to really uderstand deply the purpose of neural networks and how they actually work
